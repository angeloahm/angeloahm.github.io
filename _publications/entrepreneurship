**Abstract**: This paper explores how sectoral linkages amplify or mitigate misallocation at intensive
and extensive margins. Our analysis employs a multisector general equilibrium model with
input-output connections, heterogeneous agents, and endogenous occupational choices. Distortions
impact both the intensive use of production inputs and agents’ career decisions,
causing misallocation of entrepreneurs across diverse production sectors. We analytically
demonstrate that input-output linkages amplify (diminish) misallocation losses when the
most distorted sectors are upstream (downstream). Calibrating our model to the US economy,
we quantify output losses due to sectoral corporate taxes, revealing that sectoral linkages
magnify misallocation losses by over four times. We evaluate an entry subsidy program
and find that it should ideally target sectors where “marginal” entrepreneurs face more significant
profit losses due to distortions, even if these sectors are not the most distorted ones.
