**Abstract**: We propose a semiparametric approach to estimate a Susceptible-InfectedRecovered-Deceased (SIRD) model with stochastic transmission, recovery and death rates. We do not impose any restriction on how these rates change over time, instead using a fully nonparametric speciﬁcation to back our their daily variation. To do so, we estimate the time-dependent SIRD model by kernel (constrained) least squares, which we show through simulations to behave very well in ﬁnite samples. Empirically, we estimate SIRD models for the COVID-19 cases and deaths in New York City and Rio de Janeiro. The latter application is particularly interesting because it allows us to assess how our semiparametric estimator of the eﬀective reproduction number fares when using data by registration date, rather than by event date (ﬁrst symptoms or death). We ﬁnd that smoothing helps attenuate, but not eliminate reporting delay bias.
