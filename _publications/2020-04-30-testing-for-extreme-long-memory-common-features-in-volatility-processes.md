**Abstract**: Cross-sectional aggregation of short-memory processes may generate long memory in the resulting time series. Many time-series models capture long-memory and have already been used to model volatility, of which the most popular relies on fractional integration. However, depending on how aggregation occurs, fractional integration does not provide a good approximation for the autocorrelation function. Accordingly, we assume a very flexible form for the autocorrelation function in order to accommodate long-memory in volatility processes. In this article, we propose an estimator for long-memory processes and derive its asymptotic behavior. We construct a test for the identification of a common feature among multiple volatility measures that exhibit high persistence. We apply our methodology to observed market volatility (namely VIX and VXO), where long-memory is a frequent concern, and find evidence suggesting that the natural market volatility appears as a long-memory feature in our data.
