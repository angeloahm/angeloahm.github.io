**Abstract**: This work intends to analyze how do news release affect the cross-section of betas over the trading day. As seen in the literature, the initial dispersion of the stock’s risk is due to the fact that the market is mostly affected by stock-specific shocks in the beginning of the trading day. By the end of the trading day, shocks related to general macroeconomic variables become more important and the cross-section of CAPM β converges towards 1. I match high-frequency stock returns with real-time news data and argue that the occurance of stock related news is a key driver in the dispersion of their beta risk.

The graph below shows some evidence on that, where I display that the intraday pattern of news sentiment follows a similar trend than the intraday pattern of the dispersion of betas:
