I am a 4th year Finance Ph.D. student at [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/doctoral/programs/finance.aspx). My interests are in Empirical Asset Pricing, Financial Econometrics and Machine Learning. My current research deals with identifying the effect of public information shocks in stock-specific risk (mainly the CAPM $\beta\$). You can check all my research papers in the [Research](/research/) page.
