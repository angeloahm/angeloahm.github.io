I am a 4th year Finance Ph.D. student at [Kellogg School of Management](https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/doctoral/programs/finance.aspx). My interests are in Empirical Asset Pricing, Financial Econometrics and Machine Learning. My current research deals with identifying the effect of public information shocks in stock-specific risk (mainly the CAPM $\beta\$). You can check all my research papers in the [Research](/research/) page.

## 🎓 Education

- Ph.D in Finance, Kellogg School of Management, 2025 (**expected**)
- M.S. in Economics, Getulio Vargas Foundation, 2019
- B.A. in Economics, IBMeC, 2017

## 📚 Research Experience

I have accumulated research experience in the fields of Economics and Finance since 2017. Outside the universities I have been to, I have conducted research for companies like the Brazilian Federation of Banks and the Brazilian Stock Exchange (B3), where I have dealt with high-frequency data on stock purchases and studied the behavior of investors. I have also been member of the Macroeconomics Laboratory in my undergraduate institution, tracking the Brazilian economy, writing reports and perform predictive models about inflation and GDP.

## 👨‍🏫 Teaching Experience

I have been a Teaching Assistant (TA) for many courses at all the schools I have been. The courses I've TA'd for were mostly in econometrics and finance, but I have also worked with other fields. Please check the [Teaching](/teaching/) page for more information.
